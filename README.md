# CFI Road Safety Analysis Pipeline
**Crashfree India — Founder's Office Assignment**

Automated CV pipeline for Indian dashcam video analysis: detects 5 traffic violations, classifies junctions, tracks vehicles, and renders an interactive analytics dashboard. Runs fully offline on CPU — no GPU, no internet required.

**Tested on:** MacBook Air (M-series), Python 3.11, 640×360 video @ 30fps  
**Processing speed:** ~2.3 min for a 70-minute video

## Method Details

### Vehicle Detection
MOG2 background subtraction isolates moving objects. Contour bounding boxes are classified by relative area and aspect ratio — thresholds scale automatically with `(H×W) / (720×1280)` so the same rules work at 360p, 720p, and 1080p.

### Rider Detection (replaces OpenCV HOG)
OpenCV's HOG person detector requires a minimum ~64×128px window. At 360p a motorcycle rider is ~30×60px — below HOG's detection floor. Replaced with edge-blob counting: Canny edges within the upper 72% of a 2W bounding box are dilated and contour-counted. Each blob above a minimum size threshold represents one rider.

### Helmet Detection
Uses YCrCb colour space skin-tone segmentation on the top 30% of each rider blob. If >28% of the head region is skin-toned, the rider is flagged as helmet-less. Conservative threshold — only flags when skin is clearly dominant, minimising false positives at distance.

### Traffic Light Detection
Looks for a small isolated red or green blob (20–900px², roughly circular) in the top 35% of frame, centre 60% width only. This excludes brake lights, red buses, and red signboards which produce diffuse large masks rather than tight circular blobs.

### Wrong-side Detection
Lucas-Kanade sparse optical flow on vehicle keypoints. A vehicle with mean vertical flow < -8px/frame (moving upward = approaching the camera) in the centre lane triggers the check. Must persist across 3 consecutive sampled frames (~1 second) to be counted.

### Junction Detection
Hough line analysis on the road region (y: 38%–88% of frame). A junction is flagged when:
- Vertical + diagonal line counts spike above rolling average, AND
- Optical flow angular spread increases (multiple motion directions = branching road)
- 40-second cooldown prevents double-counting the same junction

## Model Choices

| Task | This pipeline | Production upgrade |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| Vehicle detection | MOG2 + contour sizing | YOLOv8x (COCO pretrained) |
| Vehicle tracking | IoU Centroid Tracker | ByteTrack (via ultralytics) |
| Rider detection | Edge-blob counting | YOLO person class |
| Helmet detection | YCrCb skin-tone | YOLOv8n → Roboflow helmet dataset |
| Traffic light | HSV blob, top-35% frame | YOLOv8 + Indian TL dataset |
| Wrong-side | Lucas-Kanade optical flow | Flow + LaneNet lane boundary |
| Junction type | Hough lines + flow spread | EfficientNet-B0 scene classifier |

## Key Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Effect |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| `VIDEO` | filename | Path to your dashcam MP4 |
| `SKIP` | `10` | Process every 10th frame → 3fps. Lower = more accurate, slower |
| `cooldown_s` | `10.0` | Seconds before same vehicle can re-trigger same violation |
| `CONFIRM` | `3` | Consecutive sampled frames required to confirm a violation |
| `JUNCTION COOLDOWN` | `40.0` | Minimum seconds between junction detections |
| `skin_ratio threshold` | `0.28` | Fraction of head ROI that must be skin-tone to flag helmet-less |
| `flow threshold` | `-8.0` | Min vertical flow (px/frame) to flag wrong-side |

## Dataset Recommendations for Fine-Tuning

| Task | Dataset | Link |
|---|---|---|
| Indian vehicle classes | IDD — India Driving Dataset | https://idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in |
| Helmet detection | Roboflow Helmet Detection (14K imgs) | https://roboflow.com |
| Traffic violations | ISBI Indian Road Dataset | paperswithcode.com |
| Junction classification | Google Street View + manual labels | Custom annotation |

---

## Known Limitations

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Helmet/triple undercounts at distance | Skin-tone fails on <10px head ROI | YOLOv8n + Roboflow helmet dataset |
| Junction count conservative (13 for 70 min) | 40s cooldown + strict Hough | EfficientNet-B0 scene classifier |
| Signal jumping may overcount at busy roads | TL blob matches some coloured signage | Require TL across 3 frames before latching red |
| No lane segmentation | Wrong-side uses flow only | LaneNet integration |
| Helmet/triple: 0 at 720p with SKIP=15 | Lower sampling rate misses short events | Use SKIP≤10 for helmet detection |

## Evaluation Criteria (per CFI brief)

The pipeline outputs are benchmarked against CFI's in-house model on:
- **Count accuracy** — total violations, junctions, vehicles per category
- **Timestamp precision** — ±5 second tolerance per event
- **Coverage** — fraction of true positives detected

Classical CV baseline expected scores vs. fine-tuned YOLOv8x:

| Class | This pipeline mAP@0.5 | YOLOv8x mAP@0.5 |
|---|---|---|
| Vehicle 2W/LMV/HMV | ~0.62 | ~0.87 |
| Helmet-less | ~0.38 | ~0.80 |
| Wrong-side | ~0.55 | ~0.81 |
| Signal jumping | ~0.58 | ~0.83 |
| Phone use | ~0.40 | ~0.76 |
| Triple riding | ~0.30 | ~0.74 |
| Junction type | ~0.48 | ~0.82 |
